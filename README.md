# Project Lucifer

Project Lucifer aims to add administrative controls on websites in corporate environment which provide AI based chatbots by restricting set of actions using Browser Extensions.


## Motivation
> While everyone including me ❤️ the use of AI for making our lives efficient, there are a lot of dos and don't from an organization perspective. 
> 
> Example, an employee should not be posting company sensitive content onto these chatbots. 
> 
> But since no one is watching, employees tend to get a quick feedback about their mail, document, policy paragraph types of content reviewed/shorted/improved by AI bots. This is indirectly leaking sensitive information that would be used in training the bot. And to add this further do you know, if the bot uses the learning or content and guides/plublishes to non-employees in future?


### Project Lucifier Capabilities
- Configure the policy at a company level
- Options
  - `Block selected sites` completely
  - `Disable copy/paste` from these sites
  - `Disable key input` when on these sites
  - Show `warning alert messages` when users are on the site


### Support / Planned Browser Extensions
1. Chrome
2. Microsoft Edge
3. Firefox
4. Safari

### Audience of this project

The project is aimed to be deployed to employees by administrators at organization level thereby not having the option to disable this extension at employee level.


### Better alternatives
-If blocking is the primary goal, the same can be better achieved by configuring the use at network proxy / routers/ firewall levels.
