# Point-Out

Point-Out as the name suggests aims to alert / make aware / **(Point Out)** employees on websites that one needs to be careful with in corporate environments. All this using just browser extensions. You should consider Point-Out when affording an anti-browsing software like network proxies / firewall / anitvirus / VPN is expensive.

## Motivation
> The initial motivation tiggered when I observed the ease with which AI can help find to the point answers (generative and creative) instead of browsing through several sites on the search page.
> However, while everyone including me ❤️ the use of AI for making our lives efficient, there are a lot of dos and don't when using in an organizational environment. 
> 
> Yes there are solutions available but they are $$$. Point-Out goal was to provide a free, simple and light weight solution to make **employee aware** thereby safeguarding organizations data.
> 
> As an example, an employee should not be posting company sensitive content onto these chatbots. 
> 
> **Why would they do that, you may ask?**
> Due to the lack of awareness / the potential benefits of saving time (using AI chatbot). Employees tend to get a quick feedback about their mail, document, policy paragraph types of content reviewed/shorted/improved by AI bots. This data indirectly leaks sensitive information that might be recorded and/or used in training the bot. And to add this further what can you do, if the bot uses the learning or content and guides/plublished to non-employee user's chat context in future?
