# Ira

Ira (means watchful) as the name suggests aims to alert / make aware the employees on websites that one needs to be careful(sending sentive content) within corporate environments. Ira implements a set of rules on user browser surfing using browser extensions while you control these rules from a policy definition (.json file) residing on company's hosted domain. You should consider Ira when affording an anti-browsing software like network proxies / firewall / anitvirus / VPN is a technical / bugetary constraint.

## Motivation
> The initial motivation tiggered of the fact that AI can help find direct answers with ease (generative and creative) instead of browsing through several sites on the search page.
> This means that the chances of people uploading their content to AI sites pose a high risk.
> However, while everyone including me ❤️ the use of AI for making our lives efficient, there are a lot of dos and don't when using in an organizational environment. 
> 
> Yes there are solutions available but they are $$$. Ira's goal was to provide a free, simple and light weight solution to make **employee aware** thereby safeguarding organizations data.
> 
> As an example, an employee should not be posting company sensitive content onto these chatbots. 
> 
> **Why would they do that, you may ask?**
> Due to the lack of awareness / the potential benefits of saving time (using AI chatbot). Employees tend to get a quick feedback about their mail, document, policy paragraph types of content reviewed/shorted/improved by AI bots. This data indirectly leaks sensitive information that might be recorded and/or used in training the bot. Further, if the bot uses the learning or content and guides/plublished to non-employee user's chat context in future?

### Audience of this project

The project is aimed to be deployed for employees by administrators at organization level thereby not having the option to disable this extension at employee access level.

### Better alternatives

Anti-browsing softwares are better suited for this which are more fullproof solutions if your vendor and/or budget is not a constraint . Ira is no where a replacement for these solutions. Ira is a lightweight add-on in-comparison to them.
